        "Remote sensing surveillance, or monitoring, applications are most often associated with very high resolution satellite or aereal sensors. The Sentinel-1 C-band ground range detected imagery on GEE is obviously much less applicable to such tasks. This is mainly due to the relatively poor spatial resolution ($\\approx 20m$) and the ever-present speckle in the archived images. \n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, a guaranteed, all-weather revisit time of 6 days might be usefully exploited in some circumstances. Seaport activity monitoring is one possibility, with the frequency of large vessel arrival and departure (usually quoted as ATT or average turnaround time) being in general of the order of days. Thus a change signal generated every 6 days from our sequential algorithm might be expected to catch a large proportion of cargo or large passenger ship movements at a given seaport. \n",

        "As a specific example, ports along the coast of Libya have been the subject of recent international attention, in part due to the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean and also because of Libyan political instability. Some of them have been closed periodically to international traffic. The port of Benghazi was closed in the first part of 2017, reopening on 5 October. This is verified in the change frequency plots below which were generated directly from the interface. The change observations are partly confused by noise from open water, caused mostly by surface wave conditions, but the signals of interest are quite clear. (The water mask would remove the noise, but also hide some ship movements.)\n",
